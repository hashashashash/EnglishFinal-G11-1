            <h1>The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas</h1>
            <div class="byline">
                <p class="author">Ursula K. Le Guin</p>
                <p class="year">1973</p>
            </div>
            <p id="p1">
                <span id="quote-1a">With a clamor of bells that set the swallows soaring, the Festival of Summer came to the city Omelas,
                bright-towered by the sea. The rigging of the boats in harbor sparkled with flags. In the streets between
                houses with red roofs and painted walls, between old moss-grown gardens and under avenues of trees, past
                great parks and public buildings, processions moved.</span> <span id="quote-4a">Some were decorous: old people in long stiff robes of
                mauve and grey, grave master workmen, quiet, merry women carrying their babies and chatting as they walked.</span>
                In other streets the music beat faster, a shimmering of gong and tambourine, and the people went dancing,
                the procession was a dance. Children dodged in and out, their high calls rising like the swallows’ crossing
                flights, over the music and the singing. All the processions wound towards the north side of the city, where
                on the great water-meadow called the Green Fields <span id="quote-2a">boys and girls, naked in the bright air, with mud-stained
                feet and ankles and long, lithe arms, exercised their restive horses before the race.</span> <span id="quote-3a">The horses wore no
                gear at all but a halter without bit. Their manes were braided with streamers of silver, gold, and green.
                They flared their nostrils and pranced and boasted to one another; they were vastly excited, the horse being
                the only animal who has adopted our ceremonies as his own.</span> Far off to the north and west the mountains stood
                up half encircling Omelas on her bay. The air of morning was so clear that the snow still crowning the
                Eighteen Peaks burned with white-gold fire across the miles of sunlit air, under the dark blue of the sky.
                There was just enough wind to make the banners that marked the racecourse snap and flutter now and then. In
                the silence of the broad green meadows one could hear the music winding through the city streets, farther
                and nearer and ever approaching, a cheerful faint sweetness of the air that from time to time trembled and
                gathered together and broke out into the great joyous clanging of the bells.
            </p>
            <p id="p2">
                Joyous! How is one to tell about joy? How describe the citizens of Omelas?
            </p>
            <p id="p3">
                <span id="quote-9a">They were not simple folk, you see, though they were happy... They were not naive and happy children– though their children were, in fact, happy. They were mature,
                intelligent, passionate adults whose lives were not wretched.</span> O miracle! but I wish I could describe it
                better. I wish I could convince you. <span id="quote-8a">Omelas sounds in my words like a city in a fairy tale, long ago and far
                away, once upon a time.</span> ... A boundless and
                generous contentment, a magnanimous triumph felt not against some outer enemy but in communion with the
                finest and fairest in the souls of all men everywhere and the splendor of the world’s summer; this is what
                swells the hearts of the people of Omelas, and the victory they celebrate is that of life. I really don’t
                think many of them need to take drooz.
            </p>
            <p id="p4">
                Most of the processions have reached the Green Fields by now. A marvelous smell of cooking goes forth from
                the red and blue tents of the provisioners. The faces of small children are amiably sticky; in the benign
                grey beard of a man a couple of crumbs of rich pastry are entangled. <span id="quote-4b">The youths and girls have mounted their
                horses and are beginning to group around the starting line of the course. An old woman, small, fat, and
                laughing, is passing out flowers from a basket, and tall young men, wear her flowers in their shining hair.</span>
                <span id="quote-7a">A child of nine or ten sits at the edge of the crowd, alone, playing on a wooden flute. People pause to
                listen, and they smile, but they do not speak to him, for he never ceases playing and never sees them, his
                dark eyes wholly rapt in the sweet, thin magic of the tune.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                He finishes, and slowly lowers his hands holding the wooden flute.
            </p>
            <p>
                As if that little private silence were the signal, all at once a trumpet sounds from the pavilion near the
                starting line: imperious, melancholy, piercing. The horses rear on their slender legs, and some of them
                neigh in answer. Sober-faced, the young riders stroke the horses’ necks and soothe them, whispering, ”Quiet,
                quiet, there my beauty, my hope. . . .” They begin to form in rank along the starting line. The crowds along
                the racecourse are like a field of grass and flowers in the wind. The Festival of Summer has begun.
            </p>
            <p>
                Do you believe? Do you accept the festival, the city, the joy? No? Then let me describe one more thing.
            </p>
            <p id="p8">
                <span id="quote-1b">In a basement under one of the beautiful public buildings of Omelas, or perhaps in the cellar of one of its
                spacious private homes, there is a room. It has one locked door, and no window. A little light seeps in
                dustily between cracks in the boards... The floor is dirt, a little damp to the touch, as cellar dirt usually is.</span>
                <span id="quote-6">In one corner of the little room a couple of mops, with stiff, clotted, foul-smelling heads, stand near a rusty
                bucket.</span> In the room a child is sitting... It is feeble-minded. <span id="quote-3b">It sits haunched in the corner farthest from the
                bucket and the two mops. It is afraid of the mops. It finds them horrible. It shuts its eyes, but it knows
                the mops are still standing there; and the door is locked; and nobody will come. The door is always locked;
                and nobody ever comes.</span> The people at the door never say anything, but the child, who has not always lived in the tool room, and can
                remember sunlight and its mother’s voice, sometimes speaks. ”I will be good,” it says. ”Please let me out. I
                will be good!” They never answer. <span id="quote-2b">It is so thin there
                are no calves to its legs; its belly protrudes; it lives on a half-bowl of corn meal and grease a day. It is
                naked. Its buttocks and thighs are a mass of festered sores, as it sits in its own excrement continually.</span>
            </p>
            <p id="quote-5">
                They all know it is there, all the people of Omelas. Some of them have come to see it, others are content
                merely to know it is there. They all know that it has to be there. Some of them understand why, and some do
                not, but they all understand that their happiness, the beauty of their city, the tenderness of their
                friendships, the health of their children, the wisdom of their scholars, the skill of their makers, even the
                abundance of their harvest and the kindly weathers of their skies, depend wholly on this child’s abominable
                misery.
            </p>
            <p id="quote-9b">
                This is usually explained to children when they are between eight and twelve... No matter how well the matter has been explained to them, these
                young spectators are always shocked and sickened at the sight. They feel disgust, which they had thought
                themselves superior to. They feel anger, outrage, impotence, despite all the explanations. They would like
                to do something for the child. But there is nothing they can do. If the child were brought up into the
                sunlight out of that vile place, if it were cleaned and fed and comforted, that would be a good thing,
                indeed; but if it were done, in that day and hour all the prosperity and beauty and delight of Omelas would
                wither and be destroyed. Those are the terms. To exchange all the goodness and grace of every life in Omelas
                for that single, small improvement: to throw away the happiness of thousands for the chance of the happiness
                of one: that would be to let guilt within the walls indeed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The terms are strict and absolute; there may not even be a kind word spoken to the child.
            </p>
            <p id="p12">
                Often the young people go home in tears, or in a tearless rage, when they have seen the child and faced this
                terrible paradox... Their tears at the bitter injustice dry when they
                begin to perceive the terrible justice of reality, and to accept it. Yet it is their tears and anger, the
                trying of their generosity and the acceptance of their helplessness, which are perhaps the true source of
                the splendor of their lives. Theirs is no vapid, irresponsible happiness. <span id="quote-10b">They know that they, like the
                child, are not free.</span> They know compassion. It is the existence of the child, and their knowledge of its
                existence, that makes possible the nobility of their architecture, the poignancy of their music, the
                profundity of their science. <span id="quote-7b">It is because of the child that they are so gentle with children. They know
                that if the wretched one were not there snivelling in the dark, the other one, the flute-player, could make
                no joyful music as the young riders line up in their beauty for the race in the sunlight of the first
                morning of summer.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Now do you believe in them? Are they not more credible? But there is one more thing to tell, and this is
                quite incredible.
            </p>
            <p id="quote-10a">
                At times one of the adolescent girls or boys who go to see the child does not go home to weep or rage, does
                not, in fact, go home at all. Sometimes also a man or woman much older falls silent for a day or two, and
                then leaves home. These people go out into the street, and walk down the street alone. They keep walking,
                and walk straight out of the city of Omelas, through the beautiful gates. They keep walking across the
                farmlands of Omelas. Each one goes alone, youth or girl man or woman. Night falls; the traveler must pass
                down village streets, between the houses with yellow-lit windows, and on out into the darkness of the
                fields. Each alone, they go west or north, towards the mountains. They go on. They leave Omelas, they walk
                ahead into the darkness, and they do not come back. The place they go towards is a place even less
                imaginable to most of us than the city of happiness. I cannot describe it at all. It is possible that it
                does not exist. But they seem to know where they are going, the ones who walk away from Omelas.

                <h4>10. Paradox: Freedom Through Exile</h4>
                <p>True freedom comes not from staying in the "free" utopia but from leaving it. The exiles, by rejecting Omelas’ bargain, gain freedom from complicity, challenging the idea that utopia equals freedom.</p>
